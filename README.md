# CherryTree to Markdown
Convert CherryTree XML files that are not password protected to Markdown.

This converter handles most Markdown rules. However, when writing in CherryTree, you may need to adjust some text to ensure proper conversion. For example, you should leave a blank line before every list; otherwise, the list will be interpreted as normal text in Markdown viewers.

## To USE

execute this command `python cherrymd.py xmlfile output`
